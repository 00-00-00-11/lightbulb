export const ABOUT_LONG_DESCRIPTION = `ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡, the [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) rewrite of Eureka!

    **My features**:
    - Logging
    - Logging
    - Logging

    Aaand... that's about it! All you need to set me up is a channel called \`ðŸ’¡\`! Actually, the real RegExp for that is \`/^ðŸ’¡(-log(s|ging)?)?$/g\`, but we won't get into that stuff.

    **What I log:**
    - ðŸ”¨ Bans
    - ðŸ”§ Unbans
    - ðŸ‘¢ Kicks (Coming Soon)`.replace(/\n +/g, '\n');
export const ABOUT_HEADER = 'About Me';

export const BANNE_NO_TARGET =
  'Who am I going to ~~call~~ banne? ~~Ghostbusters!~~ Nobody!';
